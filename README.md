## About

Library for easier working with console/terminal and other stuff as well. I made this out of boredom so implementation might not be ideal as this used to be part of another project, but my other C++ projects might benefit from this library/collection of utility classes.

## Project guide

- .hpp is used when there is no coresponding .cpp file

## Compilation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riyufuchi/ConsoleLib.git
   cd ConsoleLib
   make
   ```

## Testing

For testing Google Test framework is used

   ```bash
   # Install dependency
   sudo apt install libgtest-dev
   # Then use makefile
   make test
   ```

## Donate

I'm a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ student, so a few dollars will be enough. If you are planning to use this library in a commercial application, then it would be fair if you would send more, possibly a small share of 5-10% of monthly profits.
