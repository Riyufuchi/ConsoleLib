## About

Library for easier working with console/terminal. I made this out of boredom so implementation might not be ideal as this used to be only in one project, but my other C++ project might benefit from this, hence that is why I made this library as a collection of my utility classes.

## Compilation

- Simple C++ code, no need for further instructions about compiling.

## Project guide

- .hpp is used when there is no coresponding .cpp file

## Donate

I'm a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ student, so a few dollars will be enough. If you are planning to use this library in a commercial application, then it would be fair if you would send more, possibly a small share of 5-10% of monthly profits.
